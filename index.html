        <ol>Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp (Present)</ol>
        <p>A course deigned to guide students through the entire process of building a functional and attractive webpage. The course teaches students to use the following tools and languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, DOM Manipulation, jQuery, Unix, NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS, REST, MongoDB, Database Associations, Authentication, PassportJS, and Authorization. </p>

        <ol>Free Code Camp (2016 - Present) </ol>
        <p>I learned the basics of Front End Development using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript. I've already completed several projects that you can see on <a href="http://codepen.io/cailynse/pens/public/">CodePen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cailynse">GitHub</a>. The next stage will be learning Data Visualization and Back End Development. This will require me to learn React, Sass, Node.js, Express.js, Mongo and more. Throughout the course I have become familiar with using Git, CodePen, various text editors and online resources like Stack Overflow and GitHub to further my knowledge and solve problems. This program requires me to be self motivated and to hold myself accountable, it shows my drive and desire to learn. </p>

        <ol>Lambda JavaScript Mini Bootcamp (2017) </ol>
        <p>A brief introduction to the basics of writing in JavaScript. I took this 5-day course to increase my knowledge of JavaScript. </p>

        <ol>University of Guelph Kemptville Campus (2014-2016)</ol>
        <p>While achieving a co-diploma in Horticulture I took many courses in business management and communications. I graduated with distinction because of my dedication to producing quality work. </p>

        <ol>Carleton University (2013-2015)</ol>
        <p>During my time in the Environmental Studies Program at Carleton University I took Intro to Computer Science for the Arts and fell in love with computer science. In the course, we learned the basics of Python. The following semester I took year one Computer Science and achieved very high marks. Again, the course was focused on Python and basic programming skills. I left Carleton to pursue a program that would be better suited to help me achieve my dream of owning a farm. </p>

        <ol><a href="https://www.pachamamaorganics.ca">Pachamama Organics</a> (2015-present)
        </ol>
        <p>Iâ€™ve always had a passion for food, and from my first moment working on a farm I knew that it would forever be a part of my life. Over the past 5 years I have studied horticulture, interned at local farms and read every piece of information I can get my hands on. I now own and operate a small organic farm outside the city. This shows that I can think of things from a big picture perspective, it also demonstrates my ability to take ideas from conception to reality. The skills and traits required for successfully starting and running a business make me an asset to any team. I bring a high level of passion and drive to any project I take on. </p>

        <h3>Other Interests</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a very active person and participate in many sports including: squash, volleyball, CrossFit, mountain biking and white-water kayaking. These sports require constant practice, dedication, strategy and focus. I love working with a team to achieve greatness, this comes from sports and translates to all areas of my life. </p>
        <p> I have been a white-water kayak instructor for 8 years and a yoga instructor for 4 years. While leading and teaching groups I have developed solid leadership skills and confidence. When learning to kayak I found it incredibly intimidating and difficult but I persevered and came out as not only a high-level kayaker, but an incredible instructor. </p>
        <p> I have organized, marketed and managed a series of Goat Yoga classes from the farm. The profits from these classes were donated to local animal shelters. It is important to me that I make time in my life to help those who are less fortunate than myself. I will always use my skills to help wherever I can. </p>
        <p> I am hobby artist and have spent time learning to create vector images of my artwork to be used in various web development projects. I have invested time perfecting skills in logo design, hand lettering and water colour painting. This gives me an advantage because I can relate to the design side of projects and make unique graphics for pages I develop. I want each project to be special and one of a kind. I will do my best to make my clients dreams a reality.</p>
